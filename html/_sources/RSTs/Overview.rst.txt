Figure Shaders - The Script
===========================

These help pages include support for a now-defunct script to facilitate Poser figure shader management on Blender. With the arrival of new nodes, better shaders and infinitely faster workflows, this script has outlived its usefulness. I leave it for now but will eventually take it down.

Rigging Figures in Blender
==========================

I have gone over this road too many times to count, with a ton of failures to show for it. The tools have become a bit easier to use, in the meantime, and the elusive satisfaction of a successful rigging has finally arrived. This document is to help others avoid some of the issues I ran into. A great video to watch on the suject is this one:

For this tutorial, may I suggest you go to `CG Trader <https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/woman/girl-in-shorts-e56bd72f-0b8e-43e9-b251-a6bbb5ce976b>`_ to download a free humanoid mesh, preferably one that is not rigged already. There are some good figures at CGTrader, some free and others at a ranges of prices.  The description claims the figure is rigged, but it is probably for 3DsMax, not Blender. You can also use a Poser figure, or indeed any humanoid figure saved in OBJ format.

Caveat: *this is not a definitive tutorial on rigging in Blender. This approach worked for me, and includes a few tips on how to overcome unexpected pitfalls. Your mileage may vary.*
