Part 1 - Rigging a Figure in Blender 
####################################

**********************
Introduction and Setup
**********************


============
Introduction
============

To start off with: **a caveat**. *This is not a definitive tutorial on rigging in Blender. This approach worked for me, and includes a few tips on how to overcome unexpected pitfalls. Your mileage may vary.* 

I have gone over this road too many times to count, with a ton of failures to show for it. The tools have become a bit easier to use, in the meantime, and the elusive satisfaction of a successful rigging has finally arrived. This document is to help others avoid some of the issues I ran into. A great video to watch on the suject - from which I drew my inspiration for this tutorial - is this one:

For this tutorial, may I suggest you go to `CG Trader <https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/woman/girl-in-shorts-e56bd72f-0b8e-43e9-b251-a6bbb5ce976b>`_ to download a free humanoid mesh, preferably one that is not rigged already. There are some good figures at CGTrader, some free and others at a ranges of prices.  The description claims the figure is rigged, but it is probably for 3DsMax, not Blender. You can also use a Poser figure, or indeed any humanoid figure saved in OBJ format.

By the way, I sometimes assume a certain amount of Blender knowledge, which may not be a good thing. If you wish more detail on certain points or see any corrections that need making, please leave me a note in my `Github Issues page <https://github.com/robinboncoeur/mygitblender/issues>`_.





====================
Import and Prep Work
====================

**Download and Unarchive - Organise**

After unarchiving the downloaded files, I rename the folders to keep things organised. I customarily keep texture files in a 'textures' folder, the original downloads in an 'Origs' folder and the obj file in an 'obj' folder... thus: 

.. image:: ../images/001Folder.png


**Import The OBJ**

	* Open Blender and go into either modelling or layout viewport 
	
	* Import the figure via File -> Import -> Wavefront(obj) - keep the defaults and click OK
	
The `Girl In Shorts <https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/woman/girl-in-shorts-e56bd72f-0b8e-43e9-b251-a6bbb5ce976b>`_ will import at the correct scale. Note: *Poser figures will need to be scaled up tenfold by selecting the figure expressly - changing the dark-orange outline to light-orange - and pressing [S], then entering the number 10*.


**Texture Your Figure**

To put colour on the figure, I let Blender find the texture files for me:

.. image:: ../images/002FindFiles.png

by pointing the above search function to the textures folder.


**Enable Rigify - and a few Checks to Do**

The 'Rigify' addon comes with Blender: be sure you have it enabled:

.. image:: ../images/003Preferences.png

.. image:: ../images/004Rigify.png

Be sure the figure you are about to rig is set to a scale of 1. Select the figure - selection is indicated by an orange outline around the figure - press the [N] key, and confirm scale:

.. image:: ../images/005ScaleAt1.png

If any other number than 1 is displayed for X, Y or Z, press [Ctrl] [A], and select 'Scale'. a '1' will appear in the X, Y and Z boxes.

The cursor needs to be at the "World Origin". Press [Shift] [S] to bring up this pie menu:

.. image:: ../images/006CursorToWOrigin.png

Select 'Cursor to World Origin. The cursor should be between the feet of the figure, which is where imported OBJs generally land.


**Remove 'Doubles'**

Applying your rig will fail if vertices that occupy the same space are detected. Note: *in the case of Poser figures, I have removed thousands*.

For the sake of simplicity, I hide any part of the scene that I am not immediately working on:

.. image:: ../images/007HideInViewpt.png

[TAB] into Edit mode, check that you are in vertex mode (not face or edge), press [A] to select all vertices and from Mesh:

.. image:: ../images/008MBDistance.png

On this figure, you'll see a brief notification that 90 vertices were removed:

.. image:: ../images/009Removed90V.png

The figure is now ready to accept a rig. Save your .blend file.

In order to make it a bit easier to go back to a previous step, I tend to do 'Save As' at 'milestone' points of the project: i.e., points where I'm satisfied all has gone well up to then and that would be a good start-over point in case things go to custard. So, I'll name my file 'GShortsPose01.blend': the only thing that's key here is the number. 



********************************
Loading / Adjusting the Armature
********************************



=================
Load the Armature
=================

This tutorial recommends you start with the Basic Human (MetaRig), just until these steps become more familiar. Note: *the rigging process itself is fairly labour-intensive and you would hate to have gone through hours of adjusting the rig only to have the whole thing go down the gurgler because of something that got missed. Happens more often than not*.


**Load the Rig - Get It ready**

Press [Shift] [A] and select Armature -> Basic -> Basic Human (Meta-Rig):

.. image:: ../images/010BasicHuman.png

I've scaled up the rig so that the shoulder/clavicle bones are roughly here:

.. image:: ../images/011ScaledTo.png

Scaling for this figure is not a trivial endeavour. A quick way to get the rig close to her size is to press [S] and type 100. Then press [S] again and scale down to the desired height/size.

Note the scale of the rig:

.. image:: ../images/012ReviewScale.png

To set the values to 1, press [Ctrl] [A], and select 'Scale'.

Notice that a lot of the rig is hidden in the figure. You will want it to *seem* like it's always in front of the figure:

.. image:: ../images/013ShowInFront.png

Now is a good time to save. Typically, I'll start 'versioning' here, so I can go back if I need to:

.. image:: ../images/014SaveAsVers.png

When you 'Save As...', Blender will display the current file name with a red background. Click on the plus [+] will increment your filename... then just click [Save As].


===================
Adjust the Armature
===================

With the rig selected, press [TAB] to enter edit mode. To cut your work in half, click on the 'X' above the Transform tool box:

.. image:: ../images/015RigMirror.png

Note: *the 'X' is only visible - and tickable - in edit mode*. Mirror mode will move rig components on the right (I generally work on the left) on symmetrical figures. Of course, if your figure isn't symmetrical, you may not wish to use this feature.

This tutorial will not go into great detail on - or pretend to be a definitive source for - the finer points of rigging. What follows is just what I do. I try to keep things as "anatomically correct" in terms of having the rig sort-of play the role of the spine in order for deformations to look as natural as possible. I'm open to suggestions on improving this approach:

.. image:: ../images/016HeadSpine.png

.. image:: ../images/017LegFront.png

.. image:: ../images/018LegSide.png

.. image:: ../images/019Shoulder.png


Once you're happy with the rig adjustments, [TAB] out of Edit Mode. Here, I would do an incremental Save (GShortsPose03.blend).

In the Object Data Properties panel for the metarig, press the [Generate Rig] button:

.. image:: ../images/020GenerateRig.png

which results in:

.. image:: ../images/021NewRigHandles.png




**********************
Prepping for Parenting
**********************


==========================
Declutter / View New Bones
==========================


**Hide the Original MetaRig**

The scene is getting pretty busy. It's real easy to click on things you don't sort-of want to edit or do anything with, and one of those things is that original metarig. It's time to hide it.

In Object mode, select the metarig, press [M] and create a New Collection. I'll name mine 'SaveRig':

	.. image:: ../images/022SaveRig.png

In the Outliner, untick this box:

	.. image:: ../images/023HideMovedRig.png

Your original metarig should no longer be visible.



**Hiding That New Rig for Now**

In the Outliner you will notice that what surrounds your figure has a name: 'rig'. Selecting it in Outliner will select it in the viewport.  Our new rig isn't doing anything for us except to get in the way - we'll hide it. With that rig selected, go into **Pose** mode:

	.. image:: ../images/024PoseMode.png

The rig is now multi-coloured. Just to keep things easy, we will hide it. Press [A] to select all parts of the rig -all parts will go to one colour - and press [H] to hide them.



**Introducing New Bones**

We need to see the newly generated bone set. Go back to the Data Properties panel. What we're after is the Layers section. The visible layers are light-blue (on my system - yours might be different) and the non-visible ones grey. Holding down the [Shift] key - **the [Shift] key is important, here!** - click on the indicated layer:

	.. image:: ../images/025BonesLayer.png

Note: *if you forgot to hold down the [Shift] key, you will deselect the other layers. Press [Ctrl] [Z] to undo, and try again*.

Press [Z] and select 'Wireframe':

	.. image:: ../images/026ZWireFrame.png

The new bones - called 'deformation bones' - are now clearly visible. According to Pixxo3D, these bones are actually weighted to the geometry of your figure.



=================
Parenting our Rig
=================


**Get Ready to Parent**

To parent, selecting in the right sequence is important. Also, this is a multi-select action.

	* Go back to object mode.
	
	* Still in wireframe mode, select the mesh of our figure **FIRST**
	
	* Holding down the [Shift] key, select the deformation bones **SECOND**
	
	* Press [Ctrl] [P] *([Cmd] [P] on the Mac)*
	
	* Select 'With Automatic Weights'
	

	.. image:: ../images/027ParentcAutoWeight.png

The script should run - nothing will seem to happen. If the script fails, a notification will appear briefly in the status bar. The error can be reviewed in the console.


**Hiding the Deformation Bones**

	* Select the deformation bone set **only**
	
	* Go into Pose Mode
	
	* In the Data Properties / Layers section, (with [Skift] key held down) deselect that previously added layer - the deformation bones are no longer visible.
	
	* While still in Pose Mode, press [Alt] [H] to **unhide** your rig
	
	* Press [Z] and select 'Solid'
	
	
**After Parenting the Rig**

In the case of our girl in shorts, parenting hair and clothing would be done with those same deformation bones we just hid. More importantly, before we endeavour to clothe our figure, checking our rigging by deforming our figure - moving bits about - is going to be hours and hours of:

	* delete the current rig
	
	* go back several versions (before Generate Rig)
	
	* adjust bone positions
	
	* Generate Rig, and all the steps above
	
	* check deformations
	
	* rinse and repeat

I can strongly recommend `Pixxo3D's channel on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/c/PIXXO3D/videos>`_: he's got quite a few amazing videos on a number of Blender-related topics.

Hope this document proves useful to someone.
