Part 2 - Rigging a Figure in Blender

Prepping for Parenting

==========================
Declutter / View New Bones
==========================


**Hide the Original MetaRig**

The scene is getting pretty busy. It's real easy to click on things you don't sort-of want to edit or do anything with, and one of those things is that original metarig. It's time to hide it.

In Object mode, select the metarig, press [M] and create a New Collection. I'll name mine 'SaveRig':

	.. image:: ../images/022SaveRig.png

In the Outliner, untick this box:

	.. image:: ../images/023HideMovedRig.png

Your original metarig should no longer be visible.



**Hiding That New Rig for Now**

In the Outliner you will notice that what surrounds your figure has a name: 'rig'. Selecting it in Outliner will select it in the viewport.  Our new rig isn't doing anything for us except to get in the way - we'll hide it. With that rig selected, go into **Pose** mode:

	.. image:: ../images/024PoseMode.png

The rig is now multi-coloured. Just to keep things easy, we will hide it. Press [A] to select all parts of the rig -all parts will go to one colour - and press [H] to hide them.



**Introducing New Bones**

We need to see the newly generated bone set. Go back to the Data Properties panel. What we're after is the Layers section. The visible layers are light-blue (on my system - yours might be different) and the non-visible ones grey. Holding down the [Shift] key - **the [Shift] key is important, here!** - click on the indicated layer:

	.. image:: ../images/025BonesLayer.png

Note: *if you forgot to hold down the [Shift] key, you will deselect the other layers. Press [Ctrl] [Z] to undo, and try again*.

Press [Z] and select 'Wireframe':

	.. image:: ../images/026ZWireFrame.png

The new bones - called 'deformation bones' - are now clearly visible. According to Pixxo3D, these bones are actually weighted to the geometry of your figure.



=================
Parenting our Rig
=================


**Get Ready to Parent**

To parent, selecting in the right sequence is important. Also, this is a multi-select action.

	* Go back to object mode.
	
	* Still in wireframe mode, select the mesh of our figure **FIRST**
	
	* Holding down the [Shift] key, select the deformation bones **SECOND**
	
	* Press [Ctrl] [P] *([Cmd] [P] on the Mac)*
	
	* Select 'With Automatic Weights'
	

	.. image:: ../images/027ParentcAutoWeight.png

The script should run - nothing will seem to happen. If the script fails, a notification will appear briefly in the status bar. The error can be reviewed in the console.


**Hiding the Deformation Bones**

	* Select the deformation bone set **only**
	
	* Go into Pose Mode
	
	* In the Data Properties / Layers section, (with [Skift] key held down) deselect that previously added layer - the deformation bones are no longer visible.
	
	* While still in Pose Mode, press [Alt] [H] to **unhide** your rig
	
	* Press [Z] and select 'Solid'
	
	
**After Parenting the Rig**

In the case of our girl in shorts, parenting hair and clothing would be done with those same deformation bones we just hid. More importantly, before we endeavour to clothe our figure, checking our rigging by deforming our figure - moving bits about - is going to be hours and hours of:

	* delete the current rig
	
	* go back several versions (before Generate Rig)
	
	* adjust bone positions
	
	* Generate Rig, and all the steps above
	
	* check deformations
	
	* rinse and repeat

Final Thoughts
==============

I can strongly recommend `Pixxo3D's channel on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/c/PIXXO3D/videos>`_: he's got quite a few amazing videos on a number of Blender-related topics.

Hope this document proves useful to someone.
