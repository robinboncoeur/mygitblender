Rigging 3D Figures in Blender

************************
First: A Simple Approach
************************

To start off with: **a caveat**. *This is not a definitive tutorial on rigging in Blender. This approach worked for me, and includes a few tips on how to overcome unexpected pitfalls. Your mileage may vary.* I have gone over this road too many times to count, with a ton of failures to show for it. The tools have become a bit easier to use, in the meantime, and the elusive satisfaction of a successful rigging has finally arrived. This document is to help others avoid some of the issues I ran into. A great video to watch on the suject is this one:

For this tutorial, may I suggest you go to `CG Trader <https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/woman/girl-in-shorts-e56bd72f-0b8e-43e9-b251-a6bbb5ce976b>`_ to download a free humanoid mesh, preferably one that is not rigged already. There are some good figures at CGTrader, some free and others at a ranges of prices.  The description claims the figure is rigged, but it is probably for 3DsMax, not Blender. You can also use a Poser figure, or indeed any humanoid figure saved in OBJ format.


====================
Import and Prep Work
====================

**Download and Unarchive - Organise**

After unarchiving the downloaded files, I rename the folders to keep things organised. I customarily keep texture files in a 'textures' folder, the original downloads in an 'Origs' folder and the obj file in an 'obj' folder... thus: 

.. image:: ../images/001Folder.png


**Import The OBJ**

	* Open Blender and go into either modelling or layout viewport 
	
	* Import the figure via File -> Import -> Wavefront(obj) - keep the defaults and click OK
	
The `Girl In Shorts <https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/woman/girl-in-shorts-e56bd72f-0b8e-43e9-b251-a6bbb5ce976b>`_ will import at the correct scale. Note: *Poser figures will need to be scaled up tenfold by selecting the figure expressly - changing the dark-orange outline to light-orange - and pressing [S], then entering the number 10*.


**Texture Your Figure**

To put colour on the figure, I let Blender find the texture files for me:

.. image:: ../images/002FindFiles.png

by pointing the above search function to the textures folder.


**Enable Rigify - and a few Checks to Do**

The 'Rigify' addon comes with Blender: be sure you have it enabled:

.. image:: ../images/003Preferences.png

.. image:: ../images/004Rigify.png

Be sure the figure you are about to rig is set to a scale of 1. Select the figure - selection is indicated by an orange outline around the figure - press the [N] key, and confirm scale:

.. image:: ../images/005ScaleAt1.png

If any other number than 1 is displayed for X, Y or Z, press [Ctrl] [A], and select 'Scale'. a '1' will appear in the X, Y and Z boxes.

The cursor needs to be at the "World Origin". Press [Shift] [S] to bring up this pie menu:

.. image:: ../images/006CursorToWOrigin.png

Select 'Cursor to World Origin. The cursor should be between the feet of the figure, which is where imported OBJs generally land.


======================
Setting Up and Rigging
======================

Start with the Basic Human (MetaRig) until these steps become more familiar.
