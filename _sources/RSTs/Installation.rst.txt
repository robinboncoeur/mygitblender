      1. File -> User Preferences -> Add-Ons tab

      2. At the bottom of this dialogue, click on Install From File...

      3. Navigate to where you downloaded the zip file and select the **make_shaders.zip file**, within the unzipped folder FigureShaders folder. Click 'Install from File...'

      4. Browse your add-ons - click on 'User' under 'Categories' - and find the add-on. It is called 'Material: Shaders for Imported Figures'.
